# Kids-Haven-Organization-Part-2
Kids Haven provides invaluable care and support for children, young people and families in Benoni and across the Ekurhuleni metro. Since its inception in 1992 as a shelter for street children, the organisation has expanded to a Child and Youth Care Facility with space for 170 children and young people needing protection and care.
