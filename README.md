# Kids-Haven-Organization-Part-2
Kids Haven provides invaluable care and support for children, young people and families in Benoni and across the Ekurhuleni metro. Since its inception in 1992 as a shelter for street children, the organisation has expanded to a Child and Youth Care Facility with space for 170 children and young people needing protection and care.
Kids Haven goes beyond providing care in the Child and Youth Care Facility by working to support families in creating safe, nurturing homes for children and continuing to offer care and support to children and young people after they leave the facility.
Family care: Kids Haven’s pre-school is a free, registered early childhood development (ECD) centre for families who cannot afford school fees and would not otherwise send their children to pre-school.
Residential care: . The children attend school, engage in sports, dance, and drama, and are encouraged to support one another and show generosity. Efforts are made to reconnect families with their children under supervision, with the goal of reunification. By applying a tried-and-tested methodology of structure and routine, Kids Haven creates an environment conducive to behavioural change – the perfect place for children to practice positive behaviour while thriving in a supportive community.
Youth care: This focusses on employability and skills development, there are various activities offered by the organization for the youth's character development.
